<h1>Mathdroid</h1>

<p>Mathdroid is an algebraic calculator that supports:

<ul>
<li>Arithmetic (+, -, *, /).
<li>Exponentiation (^).
<li>Remainder (%).
<li>Factorial (postfix !).
<li>Bitwise operations (&amp;, |, ~).
<li>Logical not (prefix !).
<li>Relational operators (==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, >, >=).
<li>Shifts (&lt;&lt;, >>).
<li>Assignment (=).
</ul>

<p>Usual operator precedence ("order of operations") is followed, and parentheses are supported.

<p>Numbers can be given in decimal (123), binary (0b1011), octal (0o777), and hex (0xfffe).

<p>The constants e (2.718...) and pi (3.14...) are predefined.

<p>Multiplication and division can be represented with &times; and &divide; as well as * and /.

<p>There are also all the usual built-in functions:

<ul>
<li>abs.
<li>acos, asin, atan, atan2, cos, cosh, hypot, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, tanh.
<li>cbrt, sqrt.
<li>ceiling, floor, round.
<li>is_prime.
<li>exp.
<li>log(b, n), log10, log2, logE.
<li>random.
</ul>

<p>The special variable Ans returns the result of the previous calculation.

<p>Mathdroid is free software. You can find the source code or report bugs at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/enh/">http://code.google.com/p/enh/</a>.
