<h1>Mathdroid</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Mathdroid is an algebraic calculator that supports:

<ul>
<li>Arithmetic (+, -, *, /).
<li>Exponentiation (^).
<li>Remainder (%).
<li>Factorial (postfix !).
<li>Bitwise operations (&amp;, |, ~).
<li>Logical not (prefix !).
<li>Relational operators (==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, >, >=).
<li>Shifts (&lt;&lt;, >>).
<li>Assignment (=).
<li>A wide range of mathematical functions (see below).
</ul>

<p>Usual operator precedence ("order of operations") is followed, and parentheses are supported.

<p>Numbers can be given in decimal (123), binary (0b1011), octal (0o777), and hex (0xfffe).

<p>The constants e (2.718...), pi (3.14...), true, and false are predefined.

<p>The special variable Ans returns the result of the previous calculation.

<h2>Built-in functions</h2>

<p>There are also all the usual built-in functions. Here's an alphabetical list:

<ul>
<li>Abs, Acos (ArcCos), And (&amp;&amp;), Asin (ArcSin), Atan2, Atan (ArcTan).
<li>BitAnd (&amp;), BitNot (~), BitOr (|), BitShiftLeft (&lt;&lt;), BitShiftRight (&gt;&gt;), BitXor.
<li>Cbrt, Ceil (Ceiling), Cosh, Cos.
<li>Define, Divide (/, &divide;).
<li>Equal (==), Exp.
<li>Factorial (!), Floor, FractionalPart.
<li>GreaterEqual (&gt;=), Greater (&gt;).
<li>Hypot.
<li>IntegerLength, IntegerPart, IsPrime.
<li>LessEqual (&lt;=), Less (&lt;), Log10, Log2, LogE (Ln), Log.
<li>Max, Min, Mod (%).
<li>Not (!).
<li>Or (||).
<li>Plus (+), Power (^), Product.
<li>Random (Rand), Round.
<li>Sign, Sinh, Sin, Sqrt, Subtract, Sum.
<li>Tanh, Tan, Times (*, &times;).
<li>Unequal (!=).
</ul>

<p>Where a function has an operator form or alternate spelling, the alternatives are given in parentheses.
For example, "BitShiftLeft(1, 32)" and "1 << 32" are equivalent, as are "Ceil(1.2)" and "Ceiling(1.2)".

<p>Although the function names given above contain capital letters, "isprime" is equivalent to "IsPrime" to make it easier to type on phone keyboards.
If you have a convenient underscore key and value readability, you can insert an underscore between words: so "is_prime" is equivalent to "IsPrime".

<p>All trigonometric functions use radians.

<h2>Constants and variables</h2>

<p>All constant and variable names, whether built-in or user-defined, are case-insensitive.
"Ans" and "ans" are equivalent, as are "pi" and "Pi" (and "PI" and "pI").

<p>You can assign to a variable with an expression like "t = 4".

<p>It is not possible to assign a new value to a constant, nor the special variable "Ans".

<h2>Using the on-screen buttons</h2>

<p>Most of the buttons should be familiar from pocket calculators you've used before.

<p>The EXE button is used to actually perform a calculation.

<p>The EXP button is used to enter numbers in engineering notation, such as 1.2E6, which is the same as 1.2*10^6.
The EXP button provides the "E".
If you're using your phone's keyboard, you can just type E.

<p>The Ans button is used to refer to the previous answer.
It can be thought of as a variable whose value changes after each calculation.
For example, executing "1" and then repeatedly executing "2*Ans" will result in 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, et cetera.

<p>The "2nd" button is used to switch the special function buttons (sin, cos, et cetera) to their second set of functions.
Unlike pocket calculators, the "2nd" button is sticky; it changes to say "1st", and you have to press it again to go back.
(On a pocket calculator, pressing any other button generally resets.)

<p>If your phone has a trackball, you can use that to move the caret in the text field.

<h2>Copy and paste</h2>

<p>A long press on the history brings up a context menu that lets you "Copy last" or "Copy all" to the clipboard.

<h2>Finding out more</h2>

<p>Mathdroid is free software. You can find the source code or report bugs at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/enh/">http://code.google.com/p/enh/</a>.
