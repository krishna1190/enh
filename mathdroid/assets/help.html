<h1>Mathdroid</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Mathdroid is an algebraic calculator that supports:

<ul>
<li>Arithmetic (+, -, *, /).
<li>Exponentiation (^).
<li>Remainder (%).
<li>Factorial (postfix !).
<li>Bitwise operations (&amp;, |, ~, &lt;&lt;, >>).
<li>Logical not (prefix !).
<li>Relational operators (==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, >, >=).
<li>Assignment (=).
<li>A wide range of mathematical functions (see below).
</ul>

<p>Usual operator precedence ("order of operations") is followed, and parentheses are supported.

<p>Numbers can be given in decimal (<code>123</code>), binary (<code>0b1011</code>), octal (<code>0o777</code>), and hex (<code>0xfffe</code>).

<p>The boolean type has two values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.

<p>The list type is an arbitrary sequence of values: <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>.
Lists are used to represent vectors.
Lists may include nested lists, allowing the construction of matrices and tensors: <code>[[1, 2], [3, 4]]</code>.

<p>The constants <code>e</code> (2.718...) and <code>pi</code> (3.14...) are predefined.

<p>The special variable <code>Ans</code> returns the result of the previous calculation.

<h2>Built-in functions</h2>

<p>There are also all the usual built-in functions. Here's an alphabetical list:

<ul>
<li>Abs, Acos (ArcCos), And (&amp;&amp;), Asin (ArcSin), Atan2, Atan (ArcTan).
<li>BitAnd (&amp;), BitNot (~), BitOr (|), BitShiftLeft (&lt;&lt;), BitShiftRight (&gt;&gt;), BitXor.
<li>Cbrt, Ceil (Ceiling), Cosh, Cos.
<li>Define, Dimensions, Divide (/, &divide;).
<li>Equal (==), Exp.
<li>Factorial (!), Floor, FractionalPart.
<li>GreaterEqual (&gt;=), Greater (&gt;).
<li>Hypot.
<li>IdentityMatrix, IntegerLength, IntegerPart, IsMatrix, IsPrime.
<li>Length, LessEqual (&lt;=), Less (&lt;), Log10, Log2, LogE (Ln), Log.
<li>Max, Min, Mod (%).
<li>Not (!).
<li>Or (||).
<li>Plus (+), Power (^), Product.
<li>Random (Rand), Range, Reverse, Round.
<li>Sign, Sinh, Sin, Sqrt, Subtract, Sum.
<li>Tanh, Tan, Times (*, &times;).
<li>Unequal (!=).
</ul>

<p>Where a function has an operator form or alternate spelling, the alternatives are given in parentheses.
For example, <code>BitShiftLeft(1, 32)</code> and <code>1 << 32</code> are equivalent, as are <code>Ceil(1.2)</code> and <code>Ceiling(1.2)</code>.

<p>Although the function names given above contain capital letters, <code>isprime</code> is equivalent to <code>IsPrime</code> to make it easier to type on phone keyboards.
If you have a convenient underscore key and value readability, you can insert an underscore between words: so <code>is_prime</code> is equivalent to <code>IsPrime</code>.

<p>All trigonometric functions use radians.

<h2>Constants and variables</h2>

<p>All constant and variable names, whether built-in or user-defined, are case-insensitive.
<code>Ans</code> and <code>ans</code> are equivalent, as are <code>pi</code> and <code>Pi</code> (and <code>PI</code> and <code>pI</code>).

<p>You can assign to a variable with an expression like <code>t = 4</code>.

<p>It is not possible to assign a new value to a constant, nor the special variable <code>Ans</code>.

<h2>Using the on-screen buttons</h2>

<p>Most of the buttons should be familiar from pocket calculators you've used before.

<p>The EXE ("execute") button is used to actually perform a calculation.

<p>The EXP button is used to enter numbers in engineering notation, such as <code>1.2E6</code>, which is the same as <code>1.2*10^6</code>.
The EXP button provides the "E".
If you're using your phone's keyboard, you can just type E.

<p>The Ans button is used to refer to the previous answer.
It can be thought of as a variable whose value changes after each calculation.
For example, executing <code>1</code> and then repeatedly executing <code>2*Ans</code> will result in 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, et cetera.

<p>The "2nd" button is used to switch the special function buttons (sin, cos, et cetera) to their second set of functions.
Unlike pocket calculators, the "2nd" button is sticky; it changes to say "1st", and you have to press it again to go back.
(On a pocket calculator, pressing any other button generally resets.)

<p>If your phone has a trackball, you can use that to move the caret in the text field.

<h2>Copy and paste</h2>

<p>A long press on the history brings up a context menu that lets you "Copy last" or "Copy all" to the clipboard.
